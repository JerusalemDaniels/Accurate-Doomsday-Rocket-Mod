# Accurate-Doomsday-Rocket-Mod
This is a basic Rimworld mod that changes the doomsday rocket into something that lives up to the name

Simply add the folder to your rimworld mods folder

I always thought that the 'Doomsday rocket' was very underwhelming considering its name and description, so i decided to modify it to more accurately depict what i had in mind. 
This mod changes the range of the Doomsday rocket along with the explosion radius to better fit the name and changes its market value to 10,000 instead of the original 1000. Causes alot of damage.
	
This is my first mod so there are bound to be issues, mainly with code and also balancing.
		
		
Don't know if there are any conflicts , but would probably conflict with other mods that affect the Doomsday rocket launcher.
